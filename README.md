# Phylogenetic-Selection-Project
A project started when I was an undergrad at York Univerisity. This project outlines very basic genetic code and how phylogenetic selection can allow for breeding of specific traits in rudimentary AI

Click on an AI to select it as a parent. Click on it again to "de-select" it. Only two parents can be selected at a time. When two parents are selected, press space bar to generate the next generation.

The offical upload of the code can be view on the "CodePen" website:

It uses the external script/"Pen": https://alicelab.world/digm5950/al2019.js
