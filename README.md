# Phylogenetic-Selection-Project
A project started when I was an undergrad at York Univerisity. This project outlines very basic genetic code and how phylogenetic selection can allow for breeding of specific traits in rudimentary AI
The offical upload of the code can be view on the "CodePen" website:
